    cText formattinga
       Most is done automaticly... titles (short lines) are centered,
       paragraphs (long lines) are aligned and first line in paragraph shifted.
       FAQ:
        Q: I want my title to be aligned left rather than centered.
        A: Press TAB on the beginning of line.

        Q: I have paragraph so short, that it is automaticly centered
           I want it to be treated as normal paragraph, not a title.
        A: Press TAB twice on the beginning of line.

        Q: How to create table with aligned data?
        A: Set nonproportional font (courXX.fn, moder_np.fn...)
           and align simply by inserting spaces (not tabs) between data.
           What you see in textmode is what you get in graphics mode.

        Q: How to convert layouted TXT article to Machina quickly?
        A: Import it to the editor (rename the 'article.txt' to 'article.'
           and open OR create article and insert article.txt via source editor).
           Set some unproportional font (moder_np.fn...).
           Diasable advanced formatting (set par:f0 or insert command İf0Ş in
           source editor).
           Sprawle the layer (Ctrl ) so that the original line fits one line
           in editor.

        Q: I want to write in a different editor.
        A: Ok, but use some editor which
           - uses CR+LF to mark new paragraph
           - doesn't insert mark for end of line inside paragraph
           - doesn't make gaps between words to align text to both sides.

    cMouse driven color settinga
       While watching any page with text in 256 colors (edited page matches
       these conditions if you don't disable 256 color modes from commandline),
       Space runs dialog for color setting. Colors are changed by mouse motion
       and everything is immediately visible. The main part of dialog is array
       of rectangles - colors. They are 4 (only text colors) or 40 (also
       background colors and others). You can select one or more neighbouring
       colors by mouse. Left or rightmost can be changed and others make smooth
       row between left and right. It happens after next Space press, when
       mouse motion affects Red a Green parts of color and holding Z a X affects
       Blue part. You can confirm choosen colors or abort and return to previous
       palette. Sliders change brightness and contrast. 3 checkboxes tell them
       which ones of R G B parts to change. Arrow switches whether left or
       rightmost color is more important.

c    Templatesa
       Each page has its set of attributes (colours, background, recommended
       resolution, music, sounds...). Each attribute could be described in page
       header or inherited from template (if not in header). Each page should
       have some template. Otherwise the editor tries to set implicit template
       automaticly - page named 'template'. Because even templates are pages
       as any other one, they could have its templates. It results in the tree
       structure, where its root controlling every other page is 'template'.
       Therefore modifying one single page could change whole project. Only if
       the page has some attribute described in header, template default won't
       be used.

c    Layersa
       Seldom you need more than one layer, which is automaticly opened after
       page creation. For that reason you don't nearly need to care about them.
       Page can contain up to 10 layers. Each layer has its number in its top
       and bottom left corner and its hook in its top right corner. When you
       move some layer, all layers hooked to it move along. Layer could be
       hooked to the top of another layer (for example top of third layer: Ú3¿)
       or bottom (À3Ù) or anchored (ÄÄÄ). New layer is always anchored.
       To avoid cycles, layer can't be hooked to the layer with higher number.
       Layer 1. is first to be drawn, so it can be overlayed by next layers.

    cSource editor (F4)a
       You can directly edit source text of your page in the editor.
        + you can cut/copy/move blocks
        + you can import texts from other files
        + you can insert/modify/delete less frequent commands,
          that has no support in the scrolling editor
        - you can break syntax which may cause the program to
          collapse and lose all data
       Leaving the source editor (with or without saving) returns you back
       to the scrolling editor.
      For coders: if you want a better editor instead of this simple
       example from the TurboVision library, please send me the sources.

    cOther features (text formatting, checkboxes, frames...)a
       Some less frequent or outdated features has no support in editor.
       If you want to use them, read format description and insert your
       commands directly into page source in source editor.

c    Multilingual supporta
       When some page is requested, Machina prefers its version with
       current language extension. Currently, .ENG and .CZ are supported. 
       When not found, universal version without extension is used.
       You can mix any single/multi/universal pages into one project.

c    Textmode pagesa
       There are two ways how to create the textmode pages.
       If you recommend a low resolution, page is shown in the textmode
       resolution. If you trespass some limit, page returns to graphics.
       Internally, everything is still calcullated with fonts of different
       sizes and while showing in textmode, coordinates are divided and rounded.
       But when you set variable fnt:textmode.fn in the header of your page
       (the textmode.fn file has all characters of size 1x1 and without bitmap),
       page is generated without roundidng, directly for the textmode
       and is not portable to graphics. This documentation is made by this way.
       If you import plain textfile to your page, with textmode.fn
       it looks like in any other textmode editor.
       Work with scripts is not treated in textmode, expect crash.

    cCurrent limitsa
       page width                              -  32768/sizeof(pixel) pixels
       page height                             -  16380 pixels
       text page width in editor               -  32760 columns
       text lines in editor                    -  10000 rows
       text page size in ed. (width*height*2)  - 400000 bytes
       text length in editor                   -  65520 bytes
       text length in source editor            -  65520 bytes
       layers in page                          -     10 layers
       pictures and animations in page         - no limit
       fonts in page                           -      4 fonts
       links and other objects in page         - no limit
       files in one .DM                        -   2000 files
       .DM files in project                    -     10 .DM
       files in project                        -  16380 files

       Inserted pictures has the same size limit as page, only JPG width
       is more limited. None is tested, but it should work...
       If you accidentally break some limit, expect crash.

       Note: big pages require lots of memory and time to be generated.
       Try to split large articles to a smaller pages.
