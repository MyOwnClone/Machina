    dNews from last versions of EDITOR
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄa

    versione 3.10
       - Parlan function cutChar returns string instead of int now...
         it's incompatibility, but it seems not to make anybody angry...
       + new mighty script menu.scr in support package for editor
    version 3.04
       + better default behaviour when playing samples... mp3 longer than 32KB
         and wav/iff over 128KB automaticly silences music (there was just one
         limit for all samples in previous versions)
         (btw, you can still adjust volume levels explicitely)
    version 3.03
       + new flag m[n] does: when entering page 1st time, music is not selected
         from whole mus: list, but only from first n items (m equals to m1)
    version 3.01
       + Note: When header doesn't contain "mus:...", page inherits music.
         When there was only "mus:" without value, page also inherited music.
         New: But now it doesn't, empty "mus:" makes silence.
       + new Machina variables accessible from cParlan!parlana
    version 3.00
       + see rewritten help to csound and music!sounda
       + "Align paragraph..." in menu allows you to align to left, to right, 
         to both sides (default) or center
       + new variables accessible via Parlan
       + each picture may still have its description and author, but now also
         recommended resolution for vieweing (see cdescript.ion in projects help!projecta)
    version 2.40
       + Shift F3 shows page w/o pics and anims
       + if you enclose script parameters by "", they can contain also special
         characters like space
    version 2.33
       + new ParLanu function cutString and constant endl (=end of line)
       + name e_*.scr means script with exportable contents, eg. export.scr
         saves it to voting sheet. Currently we have e_input.scr for inputline
         and new e_select.scr to select one option from list.
    version 2.32
       + BLOCKS (hold Shift and move cursor, copy:Ctrl-Insert,
         paste:Shift-Insert, cut:Shift-Delete, delete:Ctrl-Delete)
       + Ctrl-T deletes from cursor to begin of next word
       + Shift F6 and Ctrl F6 make font selection (good old F6) easier
         (it works for some time, but I forgot to mention it here)
       + TurboVision editor supports Search and replace
       + scripts for inputline and saving voting form
       + you can write list of samples instead of one sample in page header
       + links to TXT, PAS, C etc do work, they act as pictures
       + animations automaticly played before pages of the same name do work
    version 2.31
       + better support for page descriptions, read about descript.ion
         in doc to cprojects!projecta
       + variable ZOOM is dead, all is detected and set up automaticly
       + whiteborder=on makes white border around picture
       + it's possible to switch Y and Z on keyboard (dunno if it helps you,
         but Carlos must be happy :))
       ? mouse driven color setting is described here finally...
         that message "it doesn't work..." was lie.
       + bugfix: it's possible now to make very wide layers and pages
       + more textmode resolutions
       + FNED - new fonteditor included..by Carlos
