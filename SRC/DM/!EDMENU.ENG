 Editor menu appears after pressing cAlt-sa (yeah, I know it doesn't make
 sense, but choose something better... clicking right button does the same).
 cAlt-da is shortcut for repeating last menu selection.
 Now lets talk about menu items:

bPage size [siz:]a
 Size in pixels.. you may change only first number (width) and not below
 bound set by the rightmost layer edge. This bound is shown while entering
 new value. If you try to set lower number, bound number is used instead.
 Second number (height) is calculated automaticly and depends only on
 page contents.

bTemplate page [tem:]a
 Following right-shifted variables don't have to be set directly on page,
 you can set them on template page and this one inherits them. Here you
 set what page is template for the current page.

b  Page name [nam:]a
   Page name is shown on infobar and may be used by objects on page.

b  Page author [aut:]a
   Name of author is shown on infobar and may be used by objects on page.

b  Recommended resolution [res:]a
   Each card offers different resolutions, so it's useless to require the
   exact ones. Machina tries to choose and set as near resolution to the
   entered one as possible.

b  Background picturea
   What picture to place on the page background.
   Other attributes may be set in background description [tex:].
   As the tex: syntax has two different variants and only one supports
   any picture on background, it is necessary to change variant
   and destroy old tex: settings to place picture on background...
   In this case Machina asks you if you really want it.

b  Background description [tex:]a
   Edit bbackground description!texturea by hand = access all features.

b  List of fonts [fnt:]a
   List of fonts used on page, not more than 4.

b  Sample >þ  [si1:] (welcome)a
   Sample played while entering page from the previous one.

b  Sample  þ [si2:] (welcome again)a
   Sample played while returning to page from the following one.

b  Sample  þ> [sen:] (yes sir)a
   Sample played while leaving page and going to the following one.

b  Sample þ  [sou:] (go back)a
   Sample played while leaving page and retirning to the previous one.

b  Sample þ [skr:] (boom)a
   Sample for hitting the start or end of this page.

b  Music [mus:]a
   Only one module may be entered from editor, others have to be written by
   hand to the page source. This modules are played in random order while
   watching page. They are inherited to next pages without their own module
   lists. No samples may be heard before first run of module, it initializes
   MIDAS, so some module should be on title page. List shouldn't contain
   more than 4 modules.

b  Flags [fla:]a
   Different flags for page look and editor behaviour.
   See bpage format description!formata.

bAlign paragraph...a
 Align textlines in current paragraph as you wish: to the left, right, both
 sides or to center.

bCenter columna
 Center current layer in horizontal direction.

bResolution in editora
 What resolution (chars x chars) should editor use.
 Setting has no effect until editor restart.
