cSound categories offered by Machinaa
  - bmusica (plays just one, loops or rotates with another music)
  - bpiece of musica (plays just one, doesn't loop, silences music)
  - bsamplea (may play more samples at once, don't loop)

cSupported formatsa
  It's matter of RAIN, formats supported by RAIN are:
  - MOD
  - S3M
  - XM
  - partially IT
  - MP3
  - standard WAV (not compressed)
  - small subset of IFF, just for backwards compatibility

cWhich file belongs to which categorya
  All formats are equivalent, their categories depend on circumstances.
  Following rules look complicated, but they were choosen to help you,
  you won't have to do any extra work in most cases.

  - in variable mus: there is always bmusica
  - in variables sxx:, in link to file and in script
    file name and size matters:
     *_s.* is bsamplea
     *_d?a.* is bpiece of musica (silences music down to d?a0% of its volume)
     *.mod, *.s3m, *.xm, *.it is bpiece of musica (silences music)
     *.mp3 longer than 32KB and *.wav/*.iff longer than 128KB is bpiece of musica
       (silences music)
     rest of files are bsamplesa

  So small samples are played as they are, without any care about music,
  everything else silences music and sounds alone... if you don't need
  different behaviour, you don't have to know about _.

cHow to play somethinga
  - You can enter list of modules/mp3s on each page (into mus: variable),
    they will be played in alphabetical or random order.. as user wishes.
    Pages without "mus:..." variable inherit list from previously visited page.
    Pages with "mus:" without value are silent (note, empty mus: may be
    set only in F4 editor).
  - On each page you can enter (into sxx: variables) samples played while
      entering page
      clicking to link to next page
      returning to page
      leaving page
      hitting the end of page
    In fileselector you can select only one sample for each cathegory,
    but it's possible to add samples in source editor (simply run source editor
    and write filenames after first name selected via fileselector).
  - There could be link to module/sample. Clicking it selects category for file
    (see previous paragraph) and plays it.
  - Module/sample may be called from script. It has the same effect as clicking
    link to file.
